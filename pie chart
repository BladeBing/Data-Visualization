##If you want to use a pie chart, try to follow certain guidelines:
1.Make sure that your interest is in relative frequencies.
2.Limit the number of slices plotted.(two or three parts are most favorable) 
3.Plot the data systematically. 

# code for the pie chart seen above
sorted_counts = df['cat_var'].value_counts()
plt.pie(sorted_counts, labels = sorted_counts.index, startangle = 90,
        counterclock = False);
plt.axis('square')


# creat a donut pie chart,you can add a "wedgeprops" argument to the pie function call. By default, the radius of the pie (circle) is 1; 
#setting the wedges' width property to less than 1 removes coloring from the center of the circle.

sorted_counts = df['cat_var'].value_counts()
plt.pie(sorted_counts, labels = sorted_counts.index, startangle = 90,
        counterclock = False, wedgeprops = {'width' : 0.4});
plt.axis('square')
